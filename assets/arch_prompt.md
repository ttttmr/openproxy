A sophisticated, modern minimalist infographic architecture diagram on a pure white background. The design features clean, rounded rectangular UI cards with subtle matte shadows. The aesthetic is "SaaS Product UI List View".

**CRITICAL GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS:**
1.  **CARD SIZE CONSISTENCY:** The four cards in the LEFT stack and the four cards in the RIGHT stack must have IDENTICAL physical dimensions (height and width).
2.  **LOGO SIZE UNIFORMITY:** All primary brand/product logos across both the LEFT stack and the RIGHT stack must be rendered at exactly the **SAME optical size** to ensure perfect visual balance.
3.  **STRICT LEFT ALIGNMENT:** ALL content inside EVERY card must be strictly **LEFT-ALIGNED**.

**1. LEFT SECTION (Client Instances - Stack of 4):**
A vertical stack of four tall, rounded rectangular cards.
* **Internal Layout Rule:** Header Row + Details Row (2-column grid with fixed spacer for alignment).
    * **Card 1 (Top):**
        * Header: `[Claude App Logo] **Claude Code**`
        * Details: `[Key Icon] sk-openai...`  (spacer)  `[Bot Icon] gpt-5`
    * **Card 2:**
        * Header: `[Gemini Product Logo] **Gemini CLI**`
        * Details: `[Key Icon] sk-ds...`      (spacer)  `[Bot Icon] deepseek-chat`
    * **Card 3:**
        * Header: `[Claude App Logo] **Claude Code**`
        * Details: `[Key Icon] sk-router...`  (spacer)  `[Bot Icon] gemini-3`
    * **Card 4 (Bottom):**
        * Header: `[Gemini Product Logo] **Gemini CLI**`
        * Details: `[Key Icon] sk-grok...`    (spacer)  `[Bot Icon] grok-4`

**2. CENTER SECTION (The OpenProxy Hub):**
A larger, central, premium rounded card.
* **Main Header (Left Aligned):** `[Minimalist Abstract OpenProxy Logo Icon] **OpenProxy**`.
* **The Dock (Bottom of Card):** Three distinct **pill-shaped UI badges** aligned horizontally, content left-aligned:
    1. Badge: `[Cloudflare Workers Logo] Cloudflare Workers`
    2. Badge: `[Vercel Black Triangle Logo] Vercel`
    3. Badge: `[Docker Blue Whale Logo] Docker`

**3. RIGHT SECTION (Provider Destinations - Stack of 4):**
A vertical stack of four rounded rectangular cards, matching the size of the left cards. Content left-aligned.
* **Card 1:** `[OpenAI Official Swirl Logo] OpenAI`
* **Card 2:** `[DeepSeek Blue Logo] DeepSeek`
* **Card 3:** `[Grok Black Logo] Grok`
* **Card 4:** `[Minimalist Bifurcation Arrow Icon (a single thick path splitting into two arrowheads pointing right)] OpenRouter`

**FLOW:**
Clean, thin, matte grey connection lines flow horizontally from the right edge of the four left cards, converging into the left edge of the central OpenProxy card. Then, lines branch out from the right edge of the central card to the left edge of the four right cards.
